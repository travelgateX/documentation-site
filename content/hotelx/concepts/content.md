On this page you will learn how to manage content data in your site such as hotel, boards, categories, etc.

## Hotels

You can find all fields in the [graph](https://api.travelgatex.com/). You can get the hotels with hotel codes or with minimal destination codes. Also you can filter the result with the rank. There are mandatory and optional fields that allows filtering the hotels returned in the response. The full response is splitted by pages. By default, the maximum number of hotels returned in each page(response) is 1000, but it is allowed to request between 100 and 10000 hotels filling the field size in the criteria. In order to obtain the next page of hotels, only token field have to be provided. Input parameters are explained above.
