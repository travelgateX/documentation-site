*What is the performance of your infrastructure? What hotelier product is being requested and booking around the world? How are you doing with respect to your competitors?*

**Knowledge is power** and that's what the product **Insights-X** offers, based on more than 2 billion search requests and more than 20,000 bookings per day.

In order to answer the three previous questions, the product has been designed in three parts, which we explain below:
