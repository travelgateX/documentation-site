In order to analyze and **produce useful insights**, Insights extracts, loads and consolidates data from products like Hotel-X.  

Once the data is consolidated in our Data warehouse, we can share data depending on each partner's relationship with TravelgateX:

* **Partners:** e.g. OTAs and Wholesalers already connected to our platform, they will have access to accurate data regarding their performance, ratios, prices, product usage... With these insights an accurate benchmarking against competitors is provided so that our partners can gain a competitive advantage. _We do this without ever exposing our partners’ data because we use anonymous competitive sets_. 
 
* **Hoteliers:** connected or not to our platform, will also have access to benchmarking information, discover KPIs such ADR and supplier-client demand, which will help maximize room revenue.

* **Other Industry partners:** not connected to our platform, can have access to insights about segmentation, profitability and demand across global markets. This data will help you forecast your own needs.
