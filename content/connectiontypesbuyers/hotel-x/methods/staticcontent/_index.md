Learn how to manage the content calls such as Hotel-List, Hotel-Room, Hotel-Board, Hotel-Category, Destinations and Metadata. 

We strongly recommend that our Buyers implement content calls as supplier codes might differ from the ones returned through our API. The metadata call is also extremely important when considering connecting a Seller, as it returns all the restrictions and settings for that Seller.
