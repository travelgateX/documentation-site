Channel-X is an aggregating tool that allows a third partner to receive the product of the different Channel Managers in an unique standardized API. The objective of this solution is to **speed up** the extraction and the combination of the product for the Buyer. In order for this to work, Buyers should develop the *Channel-X* integration to receive the inventory in their system and be able to dispatch all the information to their clients.
