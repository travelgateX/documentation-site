**Method Goals**
This method aims to create a payment request of the indicated amount.

**Request Format**
The CreatePayment request requires a Transaction object.

**Response Format**
The response contains a payment Id and a url to redirect the customer. If the payment doesn't require the clients redirect it won't return the "Redirects" object and will return information about the payment.
