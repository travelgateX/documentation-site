### Method Goals


This method aims to return price of the SelectedOptions . This options
**must** be selected in the previous step ( Availability ).

This message allows the partners to know the applied conditions on the
chosen transfers.



### Remarks


Some suppliers do not provide this method. If this is the case, our
integration will internally call an Availability method and will filter
the results in order to refresh the information and produce a RateRuleRS.

### RateRuleRS Description


The returned XML is similar to the result of the Availability call. The
main difference is that instead of receiving Rates the client receives a
list of SelectedRate . This object is almost the same as a Rate but it
contains the transfer information instead of just a reference and it
contains messages with important information from the provider.
