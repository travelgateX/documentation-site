### Method Goals


This method aims to return all the available options for a given dates
and destinations.



### Remarks


This method **must** be called **before** the RateRule method.

### AvailabilityRQ Description


The availability request is very straight forward. It only requires a
list of segments and a list of passengers. Each segment represents the
route that a transfer has to do, it contains the origin and destination
codes and dates. If the segment contains an Hotel destination or an
Airport destination, extra information must be sent in FlightInfo object
and HotelInfo object.

### AvailabilityRS Description


The response of this method will contain a list of transfers and a list
of rates. The transfer object contains information related to the
vehicle that operates the transfer (it also contains the destination
codes and dates). Each received rate contains a pricing and a list of
options that reference a transfer on the transfer list. All the options
received in a rate have the same price. If the rate is OW their options
are combinable with options of other rates but if the rate is RT, they
are just combinable with other options of the same rate.

| @Rate/providerCode				| 1		| String	| Contains the code of the provider that offers this rate.	|
| @Rate/rateType				| 1		| eRateType	| Indicates if the rate is OW (one-way) or RT (return). The One-Way rates are combinable, but the return ones are not combinable.	|
| @Rate/Options					| 1 		| Options	| Contains a list of options that belong to this rate.	|
| @Options/Option				| 1..n		| OptionRate	| Contains a list of OptionRate.			|
| @OptionRate/status				| 1		| String	| Indicates the status of the option if the provider returns this information. This is a plain text of the status returned by the provider, this means that each provider may send it's own status codes/messages. 	|

| @OptionRate/Parameters			| 1		| Parameters	| Contains a list of Parameter objects. These objects contain information that the integration needs to proceed with the booking process. The information contained in this objects is not relevant for the agency but is really important to spread it during the booking process. This means that a parameter returned in AvailabilityRS should be received by the integration on RateRuleRQ, returned on RateRuleRS and received by the integration again on BookRQ. This is very important to ensure the correct functionality of the integration. One of the most typical Parameter's use is to spread a sessionID.		|
