### BookRQ Description


The request format works the same way as the RateRule request. The main
difference is that the passengers also include name and surname
information and indicate which of them is the customer of the
reservation. This request also contains a locator that identifies the
reservation in the client system (the types of this locator must be
always CLIENT).
