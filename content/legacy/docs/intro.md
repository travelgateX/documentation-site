# XML Travelgate Introduction


XML Travelgate's API allows clients to access content from
XML Travelgate's inventory of partners. Currently there are more than
600 suppliers including switching platforms, bedbanks, direct hotel
chains, rent a car, ferries, rail, flights and activities companies
connected to our system. Use this API to query, check for availability
and book fares. It can be accessed by any third-party system such as
tour-operator systems, B2C and B2B web applications or third-party
applications. Scalability is not an issue. Our systems are used to heavy
load and are monitored 24x7.

The XML Travelgate Hotel PUSH API allows Channel Managers or Hotel Rate
Distributors (Suppliers) to distribute rates and availability over a
range of Hotel Booking Channels (Sellers).

The XML Travelgate Hub aims to be a single entry point for integrations
of all types. It works on SOAP via http or https. A user/password is
needed to access the web service.
