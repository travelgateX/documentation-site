### Method Goals


This method returns the supplier's geographic tree where each node indicates whether the request is accessible from availability, indicated with a parameter with values true or false. The main difference between the methods GeographicalTree and DestinationTree is
that GeographicalTree has this boolean parameter.



### Request Format


The request not requires any element, it is empty.



### Response Format


The result returns a list of *DestinationTree* with corresponding
sub-destinations.



### Remarks


The maximum time permitted in our system before the connection is closed is **240000** milliseconds.

There are two essential definitions which need to be clear in order to understand the difference between city and zone:

1. types of nodes
2. if these nodes are accessible or not.

Let's start with the two types of nodes. There are two types of nodes: the parent node, also called DestinationTree node, and the child node, also named Destination leaf node. A parent can have zero to n children ( 0..n ) and a child can only one parent ( 1..1 ). For example, the DestinationTree code = "ES" is the parent of the DestinationLeaf code = "BAL", "AST" and "AND" and at the same time DestinationTree code = "BAL" is also a the parent of the DestinationLeaf code = "PAL0" and "ALC0", and so on.

Accessible on an **availability** level means that it is possible to perform an availability for that zone. A node is accessible when the tag avail is set to true. If it is set to false the node is not accessible and consequently, not available.

Therefore:

-   **City:** Lowest accessible node.
-   **Zone:** Not the lowest accessible node.

 **Note:** *In rare occasions, it is possible to find nodes lower than cities, which won't be accessible, but the standard scenario is not to find lower nodes than cities.*
