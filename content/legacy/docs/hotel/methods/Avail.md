### Method Goals


This method aims to return all the available options for a given date
and itinerary. It does not filter different classes, times or fares. It
will always retrieve all results returned by the supplier.


### Request Format


The availability request is very straight forward. It only requires
destination, travel dates and the number of pax in each room.


### Response Format


Results are organized in this hierarchy=

-   *Hotel* :

A list with all the hotels, including hotel name and code, *mealplans*
list, etc. returned by the supplier.

-   *Mealplans* :

A list of all MealPlans returned by the supplier, every *mealplan* and
its code. Every *mealplan* also contains a list of *options* for this
availability.

-   *Options* :

A list with all the *options* returned for each mealplan, every *option*
includes the total price, the conditions and room description.

The price returned should be "all inclusive". All fares, taxes and
discounts are included in the total price.



### Observations


This method **must** be called **before** the *Valuation* method.

Our system allows for a max **25000** milliseconds before the connection
is closed.

### Detailed description

**AvailDestinations:**

AvailDestinations indicates what destinations will be requested to the supplier. 

Hotel codes or other destination codes must be defined using information specified in  [MetaData](https://docs.travelgatex.com/legacy/docs/hotel/methods/metadata/).

*MaxNumberHotels*, *MaxNumberCities*, *MaxNumberZones* and *MaxNumberGeoCodes* indicates how client should group avail requests to supplier.

It's the client's resposability to do performance tests in order to determine what's the best strategy regarding group destinations in an Avail Request. This strategy may vary depending on execution time, response size or other client's expectations.


**BusinessRules:**

BusinessRules uses *optionsQuota*, go to [Common-Elements](https://docs.travelgatex.com/legacy/docs/hotel/methods/common-elements/) for more
information.

This tag will only be used for suppliers availability responses
returning a very large number of options, about 20.000+ in same
response.

Currently, the client can configure the following BusinessRules:

* *CheaperAmount*:

  The cheapest options is returned without exceeding the
  *optionsQuota* limit.

* *RoomType*: 

  The options are filtered using a limited combination of
  rooms types. First, we group same room types so you receive
  options with the same type/classificatory (For example:
  Standard-Standard-Standard-Standard, Junior-Junior-Junior-Junior...). Then
  we combine the cheapest rooms with the remaining rooms, always
  checking for duplicates and without execeeding the *optionsQuota* limit.

  If the client sets BusinessRules value, then these will be applied
  when number of options returned exceeds *optionsQuota*. If the client
  does not set any BusinessRules values, then the *CheaperAmount*
  BusinessRule is applied by default.



**Price, binding price and commission:**

Every option has a price and every price indicates the currency,
amount, if it is binding and the commission.

-   *Binding:*

If binding is set as true, then the client can't sell the product for a
lower price then the one set by the supplier. If it set as as false, the
client can sell the product for a lower price.

-   *Commission:*

   > -   Commission = 0: the price returned is net.
   > -   Commission = -1: the supplier has not supplied the sale price
   >     nor the commission. This information is in the commercial contract with the supplier.
   > -   Commission is greater than 0: X = % of the commission applied to the amount

*Below are 4 possible scenarios:*

~~~xml
    <Price currency = "EUR" amount = "200" binding = "false" commission = "-1"/>
~~~
We have no way of knowing if the price is PVP or net, given that
the commission is not sent to us via XML. The commission is established
by contract.

~~~xml
    <Price currency = "EUR" amount = "300" binding = "true" commission = "-1"/>
~~~
The price is PVP, the commission is not sent to us via XML. The
commission is established by contract.

~~~xml
    <Price currency = "EUR" amount = "150" binding = "true/false" commission = "20"/>
~~~
The price is PVP with a commission of 20%. The binding in this case can
be true or false.

~~~xml
    <Price currency = "EUR" amount = "100" binding = "false" commission = "0"/>
~~~
The price is net.



**Currency:**

The currency node indicates which currency you want to use in your
request.

This field will be sent to the supplier provided that the the supplier
allows for it in this method, otherwise it won't be sent.

If the supplier allows for the field currency to be used, we can't
guarantee that the response will be returned in the currency you requested, as we
always work with the native code of the supplier. For example if you
requested EUR but the supplier only works with GBP, the supplier will
return in GBP, and we will pass it on to you in GBP.



**PAX ages:**

The range of what is considered an adult, infant or baby is particular
to each supplier.

We don't have a standardization of the paxs ages, we adapt to what the
suppliers determine. For one supplier a child age might range from 1 to 15
years old, for others, a 13 years old is considered an adult. We will
always use the supplier´s definition. If the suppliers requires it, we
will convert the age of a pax to a pax type (for example, convert a 30
year old pax to an adult ) or send directly the age of the pax. This
depends on the supplier's request.   


**Note:** *Once the age as been established for each pax then it must not be
modified in the remaining methods, like for example in valuation.*   



**Cancellation policies:**

The cancellation policies or penalties may be displayed in the
response, as long as the parameter <CancellationPolicies> is set as
true in the request and that the supplier provides this information in
the availability method.

**HoursBefore:** cancellation fees applicable *x* number of hours before the check in date.

**Type:** 
There are three values that can be inside types:

> -   *Noches:* Indicates the number of nights to be penalized.

> -   *Porcentaje:*Indicates the percentage to pay based on the option price.

> -   *Importe:* Indicates the exact amount  payable.


**On Request:**

The on request option may be displayed in the response provided that the
parameter <OnRequest> is set as true in the request. In case that the
parameter <OnRequest> is set as false, the integration will filter
this option in AvailRS only if the supplier provides us this information
in the availability method.



**Rate conditions:**

-   The extra fee for a **nonRefundable** cancellation is a 100% from
    the moment the reservation is created.
-   The supplier can return options for pax: older than 55 years old,
    i.e. options that can only be sold to people who are 55 and older.
    In this case we will return the condition: rate 55 years old.
-   In the case of pax older than **60 years** and **65 years** the same
    process applies.
-   The rate **package** means that the product can't be sold separately
    from another product attached to it, such as a flight.
-   The rate **CanaryResident** is applicable to Canary Islands
    residents only.
-   The rate **BalearicResident** is applicable to Balearic Islands
    residents only.
-   The rate **largeFamily** is applied to large families and is
    determined by each supplier.Check *remarks* for more details.
-   The rate **honeymoon** is applied to those who just got married and
    is determined by each supplier. Check *remarks* for more details.
-   The rate **publicServant** is applicable to public servants only.
-   The rate **unemployed** is applied to those without work.

**Offers:**

Depending on the supplier, the information concerning offers can be displayed at a room level or in the option level in AvailRS.

**Status options:**

The possible values in status in response are OK or RQ:

~~~xml
    <Option type = "Hotel" paymentType = "MerchantPay" status = "OK">
~~~

In the case  the client doesn't want to display the options in a
status RQ, we can filter the options as long as the supplier specifies
the status and the <OnRequest> tag is set in AvailRQ. In
case the supplier doesn't specify the status, the element AllowOnRequest in [MetaData](https://docs.travelgatex.com/legacy/docs/hotel/methods/metadata/) needs to be set as FALSE.





**POI cases Examples:**

Case 1:

~~~xml
    <POIs>
      <POI code = "8A" Description = "Andorra">
        <Services>
          <Service type = "SkiPass" code = "F1"
          description = "Forfait" durationType = "Range"
          quantity = "0" unit = "Day">
            <RangeDates startDate = "28/01/2014"
            endDate = "29/01/2014"/>
          </Service>
        </Services>
      </POI>
    </POIs>
~~~

Specifying the quantity is unnecessary as the start and end dates for the service have already been set.



Case 2:

~~~xml
    <POIs>
      <POI code = "8A" Description = "Andorra">
        <Services>
          <Service type = "SkiPass" code = "F1"
          description = "Forfait" durationType = "open"
          quantity = "5" unit = "Hour">
          </Service>
        </Services>
      </POI>
    </POIs>
~~~

In this case, quantity is applicable for the entire stay, i.e., the client
can enjoy the skipass for 5 hours any day of the stay.



Case 3:

~~~xml
    <POIs>
      <POI code = "8A" Description = "Andorra">
        <Services>
          <Service type = "SkiPass" code = "F1"
          description = "Forfait" durationType = "open"
          quantity = "2" unit = "Day">
          </Service>
        </Services>
      </POI>
    </POIs>
~~~

In this case, quantity is applicable for the entire stay, i.e., the client
can enjoy until 2 days of skipass in between the check in and check out.



**Note:** *Keep the parameters in the avail response to include them in the valuation request.*

~~~xml
    <Parameters>
       <Parameter key = "sesion" value = "888de014"/>
    </Parameters>
~~~

**Fees:**

If the supplier is returning fees, we need to know whether those have to be paid when the consumer gets to the hotel or beforehand. Keep in mind the type of payment for the option and that payment of the fees is MANDATORY:

* MerchantPay/CardBookingPay/CardChekInPay: if includedPriceOption = True the amount of the fee is already included in the price and is paid at the time of booking. If, however, includedPriceOption = False, said fee have to be paid in the hotel.

* LaterPay: In both cases if includedPriceOption = True/False,  the amount of the fee has to be paid in the hotel, as the type of payment is LaterPay. The difference is that if  includedPriceOption = False the client would have to sum the amount on their end. This is done if the supplier does not include it. This way, the client can show the fee on their web separated from the option price, and it’s now the client’s own decision how they should treat it.
