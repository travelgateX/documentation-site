### Method Goals


This method provides information about the meta data of the
supplier so that it can be effectively configured.



### Request Format


The request does not require any elements - empty request.



### Response Format


The XML response contains many elements of the supplier's meta data: number of hotels, number of cities and number of areas available, maximum number of *roomcandidate*, maximum number of paxes in a *roomcandidate*, release days, minimum stay, 
list of languages supported ...

It is separated in the following sections:

- Avail
- Valuation
- Reservation
- ReservationRead
- ReservationList
- Cancel
- Batch
- Generic

Clarification - All information contained within the Avail section relates to the availability method and all information contained within the Valuation section, relates to the valuation method, and so on.

### Detailed description

**reviewDate attribute:**

The attribute called reviewDate will let you know when the field was last reviewed, thus ensuring that you can trust the information as being up to date.

**Tags structure:**

Some tags were renamed, so that they follow a certain standard of coherence. With this in mind, we will differentiate between 4 types of tags, depending on how it starts:

- *Implements:* It shows whether a call has been implemented or not.

- *Inform:* It indicates whether the information provided in our RS lets you see any optional fields such as rates.

- *Required:* It indicates whether any field, either in our RQ or in our RS, is required, in order for the logs to be valid. For example, whether the Nationality field is required or whether it is required to implement the list of rooms because we do not provide a description for them.

- *Allows:* It indicates whether an optional field in our RQ is allowed to display additional items. For example the onrequest in availability.

**Avail:**

*MaxNumberHotelsRecommended, MaxNumberCitiesRecommended, MaxNumberZonesRecommended, MaxNumberGeoCodesRecommended:* These tags indicate what the recommended number of Cities/Hotels/Zones or Geocodes is for each supplier are. This means that even if a supplier allows for a search of up to 500 at a time, they may recommend that you do not exceed 200, thus way avoiding TimeOut errors and showing results in time. In the majority of cases the maximum number of hotels allowed is the same as the recommended number of hotels (MaxNumberHotels = MaxNumberHotelsRecommended). There are, however, a few cases in which it can be different.

**Reservation:**

*AllowsPreferences:* In this tag it indicates what types of preferences the provider allows at the hotel and / or room level.

   - **Preference**: Each of these tags will specify the type of preference allowed and at what level it can be requested
    - hotel => at the option / general level.
    - room => at room level.
   - **PreferenceType**: The types that allow, the possible values are:
    - Smoker
    - NonSmoker
    - ExtraBed
    - Cradle
    - DoubleBed
    - TwinBeds
    - ContiguosRooms
    - Wedding
    - LateArrival
    - LateCheckOut
    - EarlyCheckIn
    - GroundFloor
    - TopFlor
    - WithoutVoucher
                    
   - **Value** :
    - **mandatory**: Here we will specify if it is necessary to pass a value in the Preference tag in reservation request.
    - **type**: Then you must specify the type of value that can be sent in tag type. This type is an Enum that could be:
        - string
        - numeric
        - boolean
                 
   - **Example 1**:
     - MetaData:
     ~~~xml
         <Preference hotel = "false" room = "true">
            <PreferenceType>Smoker</PreferenceType>
            <Value mandatory = "false"/>
         </Preference>
     ~~~
     - Reservation:
     ~~~xml
          <Preference type = "Smoker"></Preference>
     ~~~
   - **Example 2**:
     - MetaData:
     ~~~xml
         <Preference hotel = "false" room = "true">
            <PreferenceType>LateArrival</PreferenceType>
            <Value mandatory = "true" type = "string"/>
         </Preference>
     ~~~
     - Reservation:
     ~~~xml
          <Preference type = "LateArrival">14:00</Preference>
     ~~~

**Reservation Read, ReservationList:**

*InformPriceCancel:* In case the booking status is CN, this field allows us to show the price of the cancellation and not the price of the booking. 

**Batch:**

*Static type:* These parameters are XMLTravelgate’s internal parameters. They define the type of download each method has for each supplier. If the parameter value is set as online, the method runs a direct call to the supplier’s system because the method takes less than 4 minutes. Any other value will signify that the process takes more than 4 minutes, which means we have to cache the information in our BBDD (the methods with this feature are updated every week).
