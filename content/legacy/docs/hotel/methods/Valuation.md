### Method Goals


This method aims to return the total price and cancellation policies of the *Option*
selected  in the previous step (*Avail*).



### Request Format


The *Valuation* request format is similar to that of availabilityRQ. It's here you will add  data to the *option* selected.



### Response Format


The returned XML contains the total price and list of cancellation policies. 



### Remarks


Our system allows for a maximum of **180000** milliseconds before the connection is closed.

### Detailed Description


**Suppliers with block allotment **

There are some suppliers who use block allotments, sometimes called pre-confirmation or quote.
In that case, you will have 30 minutes to complete the booking, if  not, you will have to re-launch Valuation 30 minutes after the last request, normally just before booking request.



**Status:**

The valuation response depends if the parameter <OnRequest> is set: if it is set as false, the integration will filter this option.  If the supplier provides us a new status in ValuationRS, then we return an error because the supplier changed the status option.

**CancelPenalty:**

Booking cancellation penalties are affected by the following elements:

-   **HoursBefore:** cancellation fees applicable x number of hours before the check in date

-   **Type:** There are three values that can be inside types:

> -   *Noches:* indicates the number of nights to be penalized.

> -   *Porcentaje:* indicates the percentage to pay based on the option price.

> -   *Importe:* indicates the exact amount payable

-   **Currency:** currency of the penalty fee.

**Final buying price:** 

If the price in the reservation is lower, we recommend taking into account the price in valuation, given that it is the price which the end customer will see. The price in reservation should always be kept in mind, especially in case it is higher than the one in valuation.

**Note:** 

*Keep the parameters in the avail response to include them in the valuation request.*

*Keep the parameters in the valuation response to include them in the reservation request.*
