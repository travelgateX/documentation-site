### Method Goals


This method aims to book an option.



### Request Format


The request format works the same way as *Valuation* but
with the list of passengers.



### Response Format


The result returns the booking locator (booking code), which could be the
supplier's own code or the one sent in request.



It also returns all the charges associated with the booking as well as its status.



### Remarks


**180000** milliseconds is the maximum amount of time permitted in our system before the connection
is closed.

### Detailed description

**PreferenceType**: The types that allow, the possible values are:
    - Smoker
    - NonSmoker
    - ExtraBed
    - Cradle
    - DoubleBed
    - TwinBeds

    - Wedding
    - LateArrival
    - LateCheckOut
    - EarlyCheckIn
    - GroundFloor
    - TopFlor
    - WithoutVoucher

**ResStatus:**

When making a reservation,  there will be a field named
ResStatus in the response indicating the status of the reservation. It
can have four values: OK, RQ, CN and UN.

-   *OK:* The reservation was completed with no problems.
-   *RQ:* The reservation was completed but the product is still not
    available, so the reservation goes into a waiting list (Request).
-   *CN:* The reservation was completed but due to a supplier error or a timeout
    the system will immediately cancel the reservation to prevent further possible errors.
-   *UN:* The reservation was completed but due to a supplier error or a timeout, the reservation status is unknown.
   It is the client's responsibility to check if the booking is OK.



**Note:** *Keep the parameters in the valuation response to include them in the reservation request.*



**MerchantPay, LaterPay, CardBookingPay & CardCheckInPay**

- PaymentOptions:

- *MerchantPay*: The payment is managed by the supplier.
- *LaterPay*: The payment is managed by the hotel. The customer will use a credit-card as a guarantee for the hotel and the payment
will be completed at check in.
- *CardBookingPay*: The payment is managed by the supplier. The payment is effectuated at the time of booking.
- *CardChekInPay*: The payment is managed by the supplier. The payment is effectuated at check in in the hotel. 


~~~xml
    <PaymentType>MerchantPay</PaymentType>
~~~

If the payment is done by credit card, is it mandatory to specify the payment type and the credit card information in the XML request as in the example below:

~~~xml
    <PaymentType>LaterPay/CardBookingPay/CardCheckInPay</PaymentType>
      <CardInfo>
       <CardCode>XX</CardCode>
       <Number>XXXXXXXXXX</Number>
       <Holder>XXXX</Holder>
       <ValidityDate>   
         <Month>XX</Month>
         <Year>XX</Year>
       </ValidityDate>
       <CVC>XXX</CVC>
     </CardInfo>    
~~~


### DeltaPrice description


**applyBoth:**

Depending on the value of applyBoth:

-   *applyBoth ="false"*: Indicates that one of the conditions (amount
    or percentage) has to meet the criteria before reservation.
-   *applyBoth ="true"*: Indicates that the new price cannot exceed
    the amount or percentage indicated by the client.

An error will be returned if the new price does not abide to *DeltaPrice*. If DeltaPrice tag is not sent and 
the integration implements it, we assume that the price
range is 0 and the process will continue (price is lower
or equal to the price showed in valuation).

This field is implemented if it's native to the supplier or if another availability/valuation request needs to be done in Reservation. In case the supplier blocks the option in valuation, reservation
will be done automatically in reservation method. This information is available in the Static configuration of
each supplier.

### Price difference between the Reservation and Valuation methods

We cannot guarantee that the price will be returned in Reservation, given that this is something which depends on the supplier, and unless they provide us the price in their response, there is no way for us to return it to you.

If the price returned in Reservation method is different than the one returned in the Valuation method, 4 cases could occur. Below, we have explained each of these cases and what should be done if either of them occur:

**Case 1:**

The price in Reservation is lower than the price in Valuation. The selling price for the final customer will be the one in valuation, as this is the one that will be accepted by them at the time of booking. The final price that you should pay the supplier will be the price in Reservation.

**Case 2:**

The price in Reservation is higher than the price in valuation:

**Case 2.1:**

The supplier allows DeltaPrice and you allow a price change of, for example, up to €10, indicating it in through our DeltaPrice field (explained in the previous section):

Valuation: 
~~~xml 
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "110" binding = "false" commission = "0"/>
~~~
Reservation: 
~~~xml 
<Price currency = "EUR" amount = "110" binding = "false" commission = "0"/>
~~~

When making reservation, you must pay the supplier €110, given that you have decided not to lose the booking even though the price has increased with €10 compared to Valuation.

**Case 2.2:**

The supplier allows DeltaPrice and you DO NOT allow price change. In this case we will return an error, as you do not permit a higher reservation price than the one already established in Valuation.

**Case 2.3:**

The supplier DOES NOT allow DeltaPrice. If the supplier returns a higher price in Reservation than he does in Valuation, then the difference should be reported, as you have not specified in any way that the price can be changed. In this case the supplier has to cover the price change.
