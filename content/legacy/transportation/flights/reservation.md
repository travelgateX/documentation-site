### Detailed description


**Total amount breakdown:**

The totalAmount from AmountBreakdown can be calculated by simply adding
the prices of each amount attribute from every PaxBreakdown.

Please note, that the amount as already had in consideration the taxes,
therefore, if the total price marks a 100€, and the taxes are 10€, then
the base price is 90€, like so:

  Pax Breakdown:

 Adult     |      Amount: 100€      |   tax: 10€

Total amount: 100€ Tax: 10€ Pax amount: 100€ - 10€ = 90€



**How to calculate a breakdown:**

Lets say for example we want to calculate the breakdown of the paxes,
then the amount will be the sum of all of the paxes price multiplied by
the number paxes.

For example, if the prices for each pax type are:

Paxes breakdown:                             

| Adult       |  Amount: 100€     |    tax: 10€  |
| Child       |  Amount: 50€      |    tax: 10€  |
| Infant      |  Amount: 10€      |    tax: 10€  |

And we want to do a booking for two adults, two kids and one baby, the
configuration of the paxes will be:


Paxes configuration:                        

| Adult    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Adult    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Child    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Child    |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |
| Infant   |    Attribute   |   Bonus  |

Therefore the total price will be:


Amount breakdown:

| Total  |  Amount: (DesgloseADT \* numADT) + (DesgloseCHD \* numCHD) + (DesgloseINF \* numINF) = **310€**
