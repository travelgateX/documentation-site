### Method Goals


This method aims to refund tickets issued previously.



### Request Format


The request must indicate the tickets to be refunded, the refund operation desired (informative or process) and the refund type (fare, taxes, etc.).


### Response Format

The result returns a breakdown with all the amounts of the fare that will be refunded (Info) or that has been refunded (Process). The result returns also the tickets refunded (same ones of the request, only with the status updated), and it may return also a list of booking locators.


### Remarks


Not implemented by all suppliers.
For some suppliers the tickets must be refunded one by one (only one ticket would be allowed in the request). Other suppliers only allow to refund the whole booking, in which case it will only be necesarry to indicate one ticket with the PNR Locator of the Booking in it.
