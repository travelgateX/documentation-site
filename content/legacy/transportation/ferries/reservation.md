### Method Goals


This method aims to book one or more itineraries.



### Request Format

work with one Itinerary or with two.

This request also holds the passengers and payment data.



### Response Format


The result returns a list of Locator (booking codes). It can be the
supplier's or the one sent in the request. It also returns all the
charges associated to the booking.
