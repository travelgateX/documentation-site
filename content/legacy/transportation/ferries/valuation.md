### Method Goals


This method aims to do a prebook of the selected Option. This Option
**must** be selected in the previous step ( Availability ).

The Valuation request must be built from results of a single
Availability. Mixing OneWay options from different Availability calls do
not grant the correct functionability of the Valuation.



### Request Format


The Valuation request can be done by two different ways: with a single
Itinerary or multiple Itineraries.

-   Multiple Itineraries :

In this method, the request will have as many Itineraries as there are
Journeys . Mainly used for **one-way** tickets. There's a total price
for each selected SegmentInfo.

-   Single Itinerary with one or more Journeys :

This case is used for **round trip** tickets. There's only one
**totalAmount** (fare, tax and discount) for all the selected Journey .

The decision of which strategy to take is done beforehand, depending on
the business rules.



### Response Format


The returned XML is very similar to the result in the Availability call.
The main difference is that there is only one node Option returned. The
totalAmount is definitive. Sometimes this method will fail since the
selected Option at Availability may not be available for this stage. In
this case the integration returns an error code 301 ( link missing ).



### Remarks


Some suppliers do not provide this method. If this is the case then all
of the information **must** be returned in the Availability, therefore
the Valuation call will do the Availability process again filtered by
the selected Option.
