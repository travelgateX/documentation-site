The structure of the API specification follows a standard. This document intends to explain every aspect of this structure and their fields.

The integration will have the following methods:

| **Method**		| **Input**		| **Output**		| **Required**	| **Description**		|
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Search    		| SearchRQ   		| SearchRS   		| Yes  		| Gets destinations and events available |
| Territories		| TerritoriesRQ		| TerritoriesRS		| No   		| List of Destinations		|
| Avail     		| AvailRQ    		| AvailRS    		| Yes  		| Makes an availability call	|
| Valuation 		| ValuationRQ		| ValuationRS		| Yes  		| Makes a valuation for refresh ticket price (pre-book) |
| Reservation		| ReservationRQ		| ReservationRS		| Yes  		| Makes a booking		|
| ReservationRead	| ReservationReadRQ	| ReservationReadRS	| No    	| Information about one reservation |
| Cancel    		| CancelRQ   		| CancelRS   		| No   		| Cancel a reservation		|
| ReservationsList	| ReservationsListRQ	| ReservationsListRS	| No   		| List of Reservations		|

Each request sent to the **service url** requires a node called rqXML. Inside this node travels the current method's Input object.

The data structure will always have common elements in all objects and the specific objects related to the operation.
