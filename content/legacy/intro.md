# XML Travelgate Introduction


XML Travelgate's API allows clients to access content from XML Travelgate's inventory of partners. Currently there are more than 600 suppliers including switching platforms, bedbanks, direct hotel chains, rent a car, ferries, rail, flights and activities companies connected to our system. Use this API to query, check for availability and book fares. It can be accessed by any third-party system such as tour-operator systems, B2C and B2B web applications or third-party applications. Scalability is not an issue. Our systems are used to heavy load and are monitored 24x7.

The XML Travelgate Hotel PUSH API allows Channel Managers or Hotel Rate Distributors (Suppliers) to distribute rates and availability over a
range of Hotel Booking Channels (Sellers).

The XML Travelgate Hub aims to be a single entry point for integrations of all types. It works on SOAP via http or https. A user/password is needed to access the web service.
