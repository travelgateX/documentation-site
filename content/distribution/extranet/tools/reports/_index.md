Reports return CSV files with information about your product. Currently there is a report of a *Hotels Blacklist*, *Suppliers Blacklist* and *Hotels Report*. This first one also includes information on why these hotels are on the blacklist (if it is by blacklisted destination, chain, market...).

We can generate as many reports as we want, but there is a restriction of one every 5 minutes per type of report, and they last 3 months until deleted. With the `Generate report` button, the generation of this begins, and we will receive a notification on the screen when it is finished, and we must refresh the page to see it.

To download any of the reports, you have to use its button in the *Download* column.
