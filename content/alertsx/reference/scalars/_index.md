Scalars are _types_ of objects that are available in our schema (such as `String` or `Integer`). By defining scalars we make sure you can only enter or receive data that fits the objects in our data model.

Each `Scalar` is described in the same way:
- A short definition of the `Scalar`
- An interactive GraphQL schema definition
- A list of which objects require this `Scalar`
- Where possible, we are adding examples of how to use this object in your queries.
