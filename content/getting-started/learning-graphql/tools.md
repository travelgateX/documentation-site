## Top tools to develop in GraphQL

Here is a collection of tools we've been using that have help us develop in GraphQL:

### Schemas Design

* [APIs Guru's graphql-faker](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-faker)

### Go Packages

Nowadays most our APIS are written in Go, mainly because of speed, ability to handle very high load while using low resources. Also because of the ability to develop plugins. We've used many libraries and packages to help us, hereby our list:

* [GraphQL server](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go) -  Focused on ease of use
* [Redis](https://godoc.org/github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis)

### NodeJS Packages

Other pieces of our software are written in NodeJS. Mainly because some packages are wither not avaialble in Go, or because the Go package is not as performant as the Node alternative. These are the packages we use:
* [GraphQL server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server)

### Schema Visualizers

It's nice to be able to _see_ your schema and be able to navigate through it.

* [GraphQL Voyager](https://apis.guru/graphql-voyager/) - Represent any GraphQL API as an interactive graph

### Documentation Generators
git co bea  
Generate beautiful static documentation sites directly from schema or introspection query

* [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) - GraphQL IDE for docs & coollaboration
* [Graph Docs](https://graphql-docs.com/docs/?graphqlUrl=http://api-dev.travelgatex.com)
* [Graphdoc](https://github.com/2fd/graphdoc)


### GraphQL Clients

Build, create and play with queries, it's fun!

* [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground): our favorite online client
* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/): just like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), but GraphQL ready
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql): the original
