Providing secure access to our capabilities and data is a core priority for us.

Our security measures include:
<ul><li>A test API key that allows anyone to make queries and experiment with our APIs without exposing private data or enabling anyone to corrupt or change our data</li>
<li>Confirmation that new businesses have signed appropriate contracts before they are provided with access to supplier databases</li>
<li>Authentication through API tokenization</li>
<li>Use of JSON web tokens</li>
<li>Identity and Access Management control for registered users to that you can administer how your developers are able to access TravelgateX functionalities</li>
<li>Support for creating and maintaining internal security policies</li>
<li>Use of rate limiting and error messages where usage is outside our normal business experience.</li>
