### What is GraphQL?

**GraphQL is a query language for your API**. It was first designed by [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1691455094417024/graphql-a-data-query-language/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com). It's a new way of dealing with and managing data models via API, and is especially useful for decoupling client from server logic.

>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. <cite>[graphql.org](http://graphql.org/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com)</cite>

>GraphQL uses a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. <cite>[graphql.org/learn](http://graphql.org/learn?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com)</cite>

>A GraphQL query is a string that is sent to the server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client. <cite>[Lee Byron, Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1691455094417024/graphql-a-data-query-language/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com)</cite>

### GraphQL at TravelgateX

GraphQL is a perfect fit for all of our application needs:

- **Scalable**: GraphQL is able to handle millions of requests.
- **Stable**: GraphQL allows us to keep building our API products and introduce new changes to our APIs that do not break existing integrations in client applications.
- **Fast**: GraphQL not only allows faster response times by *letting you choose exactly what you want*, but it also consumes less bandwidth which makes responses lighter.
 
**We are focused on delivering the best APIs to our clients**. SOAP APIs are long gone and modelling REST APIs to fit a vast variety of products is not only hard to understand, it also gets harder to manage as the data model gets bigger. At TravelgateX, we're true believers of the *Kaisen* philosophy. We're constantly researching for new ways to improve.

>"GraphQL allows us to think of our APIs as a whole, giving us a coherence across all of our products and services, which are accessible from one single endpoint. It is the ideal showcase for all of our innovative API products."
