Although GraphQL is a very young technology, it's quickly gaining momentum and already has a fast growing yet vast ecosystem. Apart from Facebook's and Graphql.org's official documentation, there are more and more development teams embracing this technology and you can now find a lot of articles, tutorial and videos talking about it.

We want to be part of this community and hopefully help you discover this new technology and its features. That's why we have gathered some of the best articles and tutorials for you to get to know GraphQL and learn how to use it step by step. Have a look at the list bellow and click on any of the resources, materials, podcast and documentation to start.

Enjoy it!
