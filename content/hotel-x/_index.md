The Hotel-X API is a powerful aggregation solution that allows you to get results from the largest network of sellers in just one request. You have the possibility to aggregate at different levels like hotel, room type and rate plan among others. 

But there is still much more, you can build on your connectivity a robust business logic by using easily a first-in-industry plugin architecture. Leverage the power and flexibility of Hotel-X plugins to get an edge over your competitors. Hotel-X will replace the business logic in your system as you will get an already processed response. For example, you will get the cheapest options among all your suppliers, or different options in the currency that you prefer.  

{{% alert theme="info" %}}A **plugin** is a piece of code that is executed inside our application that gives you an extra functionality over the requests/responses such as currency conversion.Plugins are a core package in the [Go Programming language](https://golang.org/). You can learn more about how to use plugins [here](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) .{{% /alert %}}

Using Hotel-X, you will be able to empower your travel websites and apps, expand your catalogue of hotel booking services and improve hotel search times and accuracy by customizing aggregated responses based on your preferred criteria.
