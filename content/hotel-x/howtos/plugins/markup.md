Markups type plugins permits to apply markup percentages over a price, markup is a field in price composed of a set of rules and a new price with an added percentage, the percentage is the sum of every rule applied.

Although this plugin can be customized, we already offer an implementation.

## MarkupX

This markup implementation is supported by our [web application](https://travelb2b.xmltravelgate.com/) which permits the management of an organization's rules, the modification of these rules are applied in your product at real time.

In this plugin, a rule is a set of criteria with an associated percentage, an option will apply a rule when it matches every rule’s criteria.

The available criteria of a rule are:

* supplier 
* hotel, city or zone 
* board 
* market 
* price range 
* cancellation Policies (refundable or not refundable) 
* rate (b2b or b2c) 
* check in date 
* booking date 
* channel 

Additionally, a rule has an ‘override’ flag that permits it to be the only rule applied (ignoring the rest)  when set to true. We only let a rule to be overriding when it contains at least the criterion: hotel, city or zone. If multiple override rules are valid for an option, the rule with the heavier weight is applied. The hotel criterion is heavier than city, and city is heavier than zone.

Bear in mind that the plugin [**Market GroupX**](/hotel-x/plugins/markets_groups/) could affect the result of this plugin if you're using both of them at the same time. So, if you're also using this plugin in the same query, the market groups stored through ftp for **Market GroupX** have to be in accordance with the market from **Markup** rules you've also upload with this plugin. For instance, if the market recieved in the Search Option does not appear in the markup rule you're whiling to apply, the markup will not be set.
