**Aggregation plugins** extends [HotelX](/hotel-x/) allowing aggregation `Supplier` options and responses using different business rules.

### Aggregation Key

Aggregate `Supplier` options based on _field keys_ applying a selector _function_ over _field values_.

It's based on [SQL Aggregate Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-aggregate.html).

* **_Field Keys_** as a combination of:
  * binding
  * board
  * cancelPolicy
  * currency
  * hotel
  * market
  * payment
  * promotion
  * rateRules 
  * refundable
  * room
  * supplement
  * supplier
  * surcharges

### Name
The aggregation mode currently only supports one mode "cheapest_price". You will need to set this in the "name" field when using the plugin as shown in the example below.
