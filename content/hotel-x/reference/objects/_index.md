Our `Object` pages describe every single resource, and field in our schema.

You can access our `Schema` interactively in our [API Playground](https://api.travelgatex.com), but if you would like to understand each object’s properties, have a look at the relevant page here.

Each object is described in the same way:
- A short definition of the `Object`
- An interactive GraphQL schema definition
- A full list of all `Fields` in the object
- A list of which other objects require this `Object`
- Where possible, we are adding examples of how to use this `Object` in your queries.
